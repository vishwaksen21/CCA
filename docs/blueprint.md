- Use simple, professional icons related to each core focus of CCA: defense awareness, placement preparation, and personality development. The icons should be in the accent color for increased noticeability.
- A grid-based layout should be implemented across all pages for organizing and ordering information, focusing on a responsive and easy-to-read display, eliminating information overload for users and guests alike.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance user experience and guide interaction, such as sliding effects on the home page banner or a cap point tracker that spins into place as a visitor loads their points.
